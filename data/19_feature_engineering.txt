Feature engineering is the process of selecting, modifying, or creating input variables to improve model performance.

Feature selection involves choosing the most relevant features from the dataset. Feature extraction transforms raw data into new features, such as extracting statistical properties from signals.

Good features improve model accuracy and reduce overfitting. Poor features can limit performance regardless of the algorithm used.

Feature engineering often requires domain knowledge and experimentation.

In deep learning, feature engineering is often automated, as neural networks learn hierarchical representations directly from raw data.

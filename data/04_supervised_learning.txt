Supervised learning is a machine learning approach where the algorithm learns from labelled data. Each training example contains input data along with the correct output. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs so that the model can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

Supervised learning problems are generally divided into two main categories: classification and regression. In classification tasks, the output belongs to a limited set of categories, such as spam or not spam. In regression tasks, the output is a continuous numerical value, such as predicting house prices.

The training process involves optimizing a mathematical model to minimize prediction errors. The algorithm adjusts its parameters using optimization methods such as gradient descent.

Supervised learning is widely used in email filtering, medical diagnosis, sentiment analysis, and image recognition. Its performance depends heavily on the quality and quantity of labelled training data.

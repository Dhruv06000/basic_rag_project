Regression is a supervised learning task used to predict continuous numerical values. Unlike classification, outputs are real numbers.

Linear regression is one of the simplest regression techniques. It models the relationship between input variables and output using a straight-line equation.

Regression is used in forecasting, price prediction, and trend analysis.

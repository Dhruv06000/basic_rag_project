Classification is a supervised learning task where the output variable belongs to a fixed set of categories. The goal is to assign input data to the correct class.

Binary classification involves two classes, such as spam vs not spam. Multi-class classification involves more than two categories.

Common algorithms include logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks.

Classification is widely used in fraud detection, medical diagnosis, email filtering, and image recognition.

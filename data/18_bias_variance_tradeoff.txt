The bias-variance tradeoff describes the balance between two types of errors in machine learning models.

Bias refers to error caused by overly simple assumptions in the model. High-bias models underfit the data and fail to capture important patterns.

Variance refers to error caused by sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data. High-variance models overfit and capture noise.

The goal is to find a balance where both bias and variance are minimized. Simple models have high bias and low variance, while complex models have low bias and high variance.

Techniques such as regularization and cross-validation help manage this tradeoff.

Understanding bias and variance is essential for selecting appropriate model complexity.

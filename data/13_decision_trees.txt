Decision trees are supervised learning algorithms used for classification and regression tasks. They model decisions as a tree-like structure consisting of nodes and branches.

The root node represents the starting point of the decision process. Each internal node represents a test on a feature, such as whether a value is greater than a threshold. Branches represent the outcome of the test, and leaf nodes represent final predictions.

Decision trees work by recursively splitting the dataset into smaller subsets. The algorithm selects features that best separate the data based on criteria such as information gain or Gini impurity.

One advantage of decision trees is interpretability. The structure clearly shows how decisions are made, making them easy to understand compared to more complex models.

However, decision trees can overfit the training data if they become too deep. Techniques such as pruning are used to simplify the tree and improve generalization.

Decision trees are widely used in finance, healthcare, and risk assessment because of their simplicity and effectiveness.

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent interacts with an environment and learns by receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions.

The goal of the agent is to maximize cumulative reward over time. The environment is often modeled as a decision process where each action influences future states.

Unlike supervised learning, reinforcement learning does not require labelled input-output pairs. Instead, the agent explores and learns from feedback signals.

Reinforcement learning is used in robotics, game playing, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles. It was notably used in systems like AlphaGo to achieve superhuman performance.

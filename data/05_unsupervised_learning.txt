Unsupervised learning involves training algorithms on data that does not contain labelled outputs. The system must discover patterns, structures, or relationships within the data on its own.

One common application of unsupervised learning is clustering, where similar data points are grouped together. Another is dimensionality reduction, which simplifies data while preserving important information.

Unlike supervised learning, there is no predefined correct answer. Instead, the algorithm identifies hidden structures based on similarities or statistical properties.

Unsupervised learning is useful in market segmentation, anomaly detection, feature learning, and exploratory data analysis.
